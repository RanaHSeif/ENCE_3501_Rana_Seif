# Final Project (IN-OUT Registers for VSM)
In this project, we are using the muddlib library to create parts of a Very Simple Microprocessor (VSM). We are creating 
the In Register and Out Register which store the data for input and output until a signal is sent to enable the data to 
be processed. They are both registers that serve similar purposes in different ways.

## IN Register
The In Register uses tristates with enable pins to allow the input data to be sent to IB_BUS when an enable signal is 
triggered. The circuit (simulated on Logisim) can be seen below in Figure 1.
